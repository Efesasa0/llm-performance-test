# LLM playground üõù
This project will create the basis of a future project I plan to begin. I am prioritizing the main piece of software that is will be developing an LLM which needs preperation. Then later a full scale app will be using this llm model.

# TODOS (asses inference speed & plasticity)
1. ‚úÖ System prompt several models see if embodies the 2001 character HAL-9000
2. Instruction tune each new model in inference time and observe inference speed and model plasticity/adabtability.
3. With my gut feelings, select a winner model to proceed with "HAL-9000" likeness
4. Proceed with winner model with further Fine tuning based on custom dataset.
5. Implement RAG? Agent Calling? ReAct?

## DONE

what is completed so far...
* installed langchain_community
* installed several 7B models with Ollama
* installed crewai
* installed openai
* installed langchain-google-genai
* installed google-serp-api
* played with we research langchain tools and Ollama
* created Ollama testing code to asses inference speed for several models.
* System Prompts used, assessed inference speed.
